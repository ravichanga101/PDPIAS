          <p>Information Security Lab of IT department resides at lab no. 405-A 1st floor of CE/IT building.Information security is of critical importance in this generation of digital communication using telephone lines and computer networks. The objective of this laboratory is to provide students research opportunity on data transmission security and data recovery. Simultaneously, complexities associated with threat to security on data transmission are also studied.</p>
          <br><p>Research facilities of this laboratory are open to M. Tech students in typical areas of cryptography, security management, and security testing. Many of its Projects : have been recognized by professional companies and also published in magazines and newspapers.</p>
          <br><p>We envision combining and directing our cutting-edge research efforts to address the issues in all stages of secure system development. Our approach consists of three steps:
          <ol>
            <li>Identification of security problems and their characteristics</li>
            <li>Solutions using cryptographic and non-cryptographic tools and protocols</li>
            <li>Cost-effective and convenient implementation.</li>
          </ol>
